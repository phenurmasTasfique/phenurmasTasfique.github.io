<h1>Styles of graffiti</h1>

<p>From initial struggles to perhaps the most prevalent art form, graffiti developed in different styles following the initial dominant forms of tagging and throw-ups. Tags and throw-ups are the most basic forms of graffiti, which are the writings of the names of graffiti creatives in highly stylized letters. Throw-ups are slightly more complicated than graffiti tags and include the use of more colors. Some of the first taggers in New York were TAKI 183 and SNAKE-I. Over time graffiti styles developed into more complex representations that surpass the lettering and include figurative and abstract compositions. The quality of such images and their critical edge raised the importance of graffiti, and influenced their transition from streets to studios and galleries. Many of contemporary graffiti creatives now operate in both fields - they are still active on the streets, but the art market is now open for their works as well. Banksy, Lushsax, Shepard Fairey, and even the old-school taggers such as SNAKE-I now present and sell their works in galleries and auctions. Basically, There are six types of graffiti.</p>

<h2>Tag<img src="images/tag1.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>Tagging is the easiest and simplest style of graffiti; it includes one colour and the artist’s name or identifier. It is considered disrespectful to write a tag over another’s artists’s tag or work.</p> 

<h2>Throw-up<img src="images/apple.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>A throw-up is like a more complicated tag. It usually has two or more colours, and bubble-style lettering. A throw-up can be done quickly and repeatedly, just like a tag.</p>

<h2>Blockbuster<img src="images/blockbaster.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>A blockbuster is like a massive throw-up, usually in blocky letters. Blockbusters are used to cover a large area in a small amount of time. Blockbusters can be painted with rollers, which makes them faster and easier to do.</p>

<h2>Wildstyle<img src="images/wildstone.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>Wildstyle is an elaborate version of a throw-up and is particularly hard to read. Wildstyle often consists of arrows, curves, spikes and other things that non graffiti artists might not understand.</p>

<h2>Piece<img src="images/pisu.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>A piece (short for masterpiece) is a picture that has been painted free hand. They contains at least three colours and take longer to paint. A piece in an obvious place will gain the artist respect from other artists because standing in an obvious place painting on walls where graffiti is illegal is a great risk.</p>

<h2>Heaven<img src="images/heaven1.jpg" class="lefty"></h2>

<p>A heaven is a tag or artwork in a place that is extremely difficult to get to. An artist who manages to put one up gains a lot of respect from other artists.</p>
